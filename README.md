University Enrollment Page – Accessibility Improvement Project

This repository contains my work for the accessibility assignment based on improving the enrolment.html page.
The aim of the project was to update the page so that it meets WCAG 2.2 Level AA guidelines and to produce reports using the required templates.

Project Overview

The tasks completed in this project include:

1. Initial Accessibility Audit (WAVE)

I conducted an automated accessibility conformance test using the WAVE browser extension.
All errors, alerts, and features were recorded in the “Reporting Accessibility Issues” template.
Screenshots of the initial scan were captured to document the starting point.

2. Fixing Accessibility Issues

I updated the HTML and CSS to address issues identified in the initial scan.
Improvements include:
Adding alt text
Fixing missing labels
Improving heading structure
Correcting link text
Fixing form labels
Improving semantic layout
Fixing colour contrast
After each stage of work, WAVE scans were performed to verify improvements.
The final WAVE report shows 0 Errors, full structural and ARIA compliance, and an AIM Score of 10/10.

3. Heuristic Evaluation

A heuristic evaluation was carried out on the improved version of the page using Nielsen’s heuristics.
Findings were recorded using the required template.
Screenshots of the identified heuristic issues were included.

4. Recommendations for Next Iteration

A 750-word section was written focusing on future improvements.
Recommendations were justified in terms of legal, ethical, professional, and commercial factors.
